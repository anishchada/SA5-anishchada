The environment I set up was a one that utilized the Webpack build tool and the Node package manager. These tools help manage build modules that have numerous dependencies, and run JS outside of the browser. The environment uses Babel as a "transpiler" and Eslint as a code error parser to make sure the Javascript is error free and industry standard. I had a basic HTML and CSS file set up, and an organized directory with src and build subdirectories. The Node server was easy to run with the HTML/CSS/JS components.

I believe that with a little more practice, I will be much more comfortable with all the components of the Webpack build tool and the Node package manager/server and its applications. For now, I don't have any questions, but will continue to learn about Javascript and JQuery.
